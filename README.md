# Astair


This is a work in progress.  This is a keymap for the gh60 keyboard that is meant to both use the tap-dance function provided by qmk extensively and provide a lot of 
macros for Javascript and React.


TODO:  
  - Figure out a good way to impliment custom tap functions.    
  - Add as many useful macros as possible.
