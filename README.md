# Astair


This is a work in progress.  This is a keymap for the [gh60](http://blog.komar.be/projects/gh60-programmable-keyboard/) keyboard that is meant to both: 
  1. use the tap-dance function provided by qmk extensively 
  2. and provide a lot of 
macros for Javascript and React


This keymap does not:
  1. Provide a bunch of fancy lighting fucntions
  2. Provide any lighting functions as well


TODO:  
  - Figure out a good way to impliment custom tap functions   
  - Add as many useful macros as possible


TOnotDO:
  - Add a bunch of fancy lighting functions
