# Astaire


This is a work in progress.  This is a keymap for the [gh60](http://blog.komar.be/projects/gh60-programmable-keyboard/) keyboard that is meant to both: 
  1. use the [tap-dance](https://docs.qmk.fm/tap_dance.html) function provided by qmk extensively 
  2. and provide a lot of macros for Javascript and React


The layout for this keymap is very standard, as I would like the ability to remain using some OG DCS double-shots that I found on a government auction site.


This keymap does not:
  1. Provide a bunch of fancy lighting fucntions
  2. Provide any lighting functions at all


## Current features:
  - [Space Cadet](https://docs.qmk.fm/space_cadet_shift.html) included
  - Single tap right Alt to copy, acts normal when held
  - Single tap right Ctrl to paste, normal when held
  - Double tap left Ctrl to save
  - Double tap left OS to Alt+Prtscrn
  - Double tap menu to print (I don't use this so you can let me know if it is useless)
  - Double tap escape to undo
  - CAPS is normal when tapped, goes to a MACRO layer when held
  - In the main function layer, escape is triple tap ESC_GRAVE_TILD
  - Symbols outside of top row are double tap, e.g. Double tap semicolon to get a colon
  - top row is triple tap NUMBER_SYMBOL_FUNCTION-KEY


TODO:  
  - Continue improving functions as possible   
  - Add as many useful macros as possible
  - Add quad taps to top row for double characters or numbers
  - Add triple taps to common double characters used in Bash and for notes in coding
  - Find clever places to put characters denoting notes in coding languages


TOnotDO:
  - Add a bunch of fancy lighting functions


TODONE:
  - usable implementation of custom functions
