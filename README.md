This is a work in progress.  This is a keymap for the gh60 keyboard that is meant to both use the tap-dance function provided by qmk extensively and provide a lot of 
macros for Javascript and React.


TODO:

 	
1.Figure out a good way to impliment custom tap functions.
2.Add as many useful macros as possible.
