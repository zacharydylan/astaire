# Astair


This is a work in progress.  This is a keymap for the [gh60](http://blog.komar.be/projects/gh60-programmable-keyboard/) keyboard that is meant to both: 
  1. use the tap-dance function provided by qmk extensively 
  2. and provide a lot of 
macros for Javascript and React.


TODO:  
  - Figure out a good way to impliment custom tap functions.    
  - Add as many useful macros as possible.
