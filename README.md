# Astaire


This is a work in progress.  This is a keymap for the [gh60](http://blog.komar.be/projects/gh60-programmable-keyboard/) keyboard that is meant to both: 
  1. use the [tap-dance](https://docs.qmk.fm/tap_dance.html) function provided by qmk extensively 
  2. and provide a lot of macros for Javascript and React


The layout for this keymap is very standard, as I would like the ability to remain using some OG DCS double-shots that I found on a government auction site.


This keymap does not:
  1. Provide a bunch of fancy lighting fucntions
  2. Provide any lighting functions at all


TODO:  
  - Continue improving functions as possible   
  - Add as many useful macros as possible


TOnotDO:
  - Add a bunch of fancy lighting functions


TODONE:
  - usable implementation of custom functions
